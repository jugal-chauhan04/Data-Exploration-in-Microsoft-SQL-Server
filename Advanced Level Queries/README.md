#### 1. We want to send all of our high-value customers a special VIP gift. We're defining high-value customers as those who've made at least 1 order with a total value (not including the discount) equal to $10,000 or more. We only want to consider orders made in the year 1997

#### 2. The manager has changed his mind. Instead of requiring that customers have at least one individual orders totaling $10,000 or more, he wants to define high-value customers as those who have orders totaling $15,000 or more in 1997.

#### 3. Change the above query to use the discount when calculating high-value customers. Order by the total amount which includes the discount
