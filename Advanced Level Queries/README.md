#### 1. We want to send all of our high-value customers a special VIP gift. We're defining high-value customers as those who've made at least 1 order with a total value (not including the discount) equal to $10,000 or more. We only want to consider orders made in the year 1997

#### 2. The manager has changed his mind. Instead of requiring that customers have at least one individual orders totaling $10,000 or more, he wants to define high-value customers as those who have orders totaling $15,000 or more in 1997.

#### 3. Change the above query to use the discount when calculating high-value customers. Order by the total amount which includes the discount

#### 4. At the end of the month, salespeople are likely to try much harder to get orders, to meet their month-end quotas. Show all orders made on the last day of the month. Order by EmployeeID and OrderID.

#### 5. The Northwind mobile app developers are testing an app that customers will use to show orders. In order to make sure that even the largest orders will show up correctly on the app, they'd like some samples of orders that have lots of individual line items. Show the 10 orders with the most line items, in order of total line items.

#### 6. Some salespeople have more orders arriving late than others. Maybe they're not following up on the order process, and need more training. Which salespeople have the most orders arriving late?

#### 7. Andrew, the VP of sales, has been doing some more thinking about the problem of late orders. He realizes that just looking at the number of orders arriving late for each salesperson isn't a good idea. It needs to be compared against the total number of orders per salesperson.

#### 8. Show the percentage of Late Orders over Total Orders.

#### 9. Andrew Fuller, the VP of sales at Northwind, would like to do a sales campaign for existing customers. He'd like to categorize customers into groups, based on how much they ordered in 1997. Then, depending on which group the customer is in, he will target the customer with different sales materials. The customer grouping categories are 0 to 1,000, 1,000 to 5,000, 5,000 to 10,000, and over 10,000.
